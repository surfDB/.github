# Surf DB üèÑ

## Introduction

SurfDB aims to be the database which dapps actually need.

Currently decentralized databases like [ceramic](https://ceramic.network/), [IPFS](https://web3.storage/), [arweave](https://bundlr.network/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) etc. cannot be used as a database for dapps. These databases are more meant to store arbitrary data like files or metadata.

The developers have to resort to using mongoDB or SQL as their databases which as we all know isn't really web3 native.

We wanted to make something which provides developers the ease of use of using web2 databases while also maintaining the decentralization aspect, without compromising the end user experience.
